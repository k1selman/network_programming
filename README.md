# network_programming
Here will be uploaded some of the things I am learning about network programming.
Starting with basic TCP, HTTP and UDP servers and clients, I will - over time - upload more and more complex things.

To run TCP or HTTP, one will have to:
1. Compile server and client source code
2. Run the server side
3. Run the client side
