# Network programming basics
Here will be uploaded some of the things me and my friend are learning about network programming.
Starting with basic TCP, HTTP and UDP servers and clients, we will - over time - upload more and more complex things.

## UDP
**Libraries used:** sys/types.h, sys/socket.h, netinet/in.h, arpa/inet.h, netdb.h, stdio.h

In order to run it you need to:

**1.** Compile server and client source code

**2.** Run the server side

**3.** Run the client side

## TCP
**Libraries used:** sys/types.h, sys/socket.h, netinet/in.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h

In order to run it you need to:

**1.** Compile server and client source code

**2.** Run the server side

**3.** Run the client side

## HTTP
**Libraries used:** sys/types.h, sys/socket.h, netinet/in.h, arpa/inet.h, stdio.h, string.h, stdlib.h

In order to run it you need to:

**1.** Make sure you have your index.html file in the correct directory

**2.** Compile server and client source code

**3.** Run the server side

**4.** Run the client side
