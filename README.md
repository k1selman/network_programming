# network_programming
Here will be uploaded some of the things me and my friend are learning about network programming.
Starting with basic TCP, HTTP and UDP servers and clients, we will - over time - upload more and more complex things.

In order to run TCP,HTTP or UTP one will have to:
1. Compile server and client source code
2. Run the server side
3. Run the client side
